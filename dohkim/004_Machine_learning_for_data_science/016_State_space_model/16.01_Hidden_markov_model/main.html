================================================================================
* Independent mixture model
* Suppose one continuous random variable
* Suppose that continuous random variable has multiple continuous probability distributions
* Independent mixture model selects one continuous probability distribution
from multiple continuous probability distributions
* When selecting continuous probability distribution,
independent mixture model uses independent discrete probability distribution

================================================================================
$$$p(x) \\
= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} P(C=i) \times P(X=x|C=i) \\
= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} \delta_i p_i(x)$$$

* $$$p(x)$$$: distribution of entire independet mixure
* $$$p_i(x)$$$: each individual probability distribution (each component) which consisits of entire independent mixture
* $$$\delta_i$$$: mixing parameter, probability of specific $$$p_i(x)$$$ is selected 
from all components during specific time, discrete probability distribution

================================================================================
* Bernoulli-Gaussian mixture model

* Bernoulli-Gaussian mixture model selects one continuous Gaussian normal distribution
from multiple continuous Gaussian normal distributions 
based on value of Bernoulli random variable

================================================================================
/home/young/Pictures/2019_05_06_13:50:33.png

* Observation: occurred value from Bernoulli random variable

* $$$p_1(x)$$$ and $$$p_2(x)$$$: 2 difference Gaussian normal distributions

* active component: selected Gaussian normal distributions ($$$p_1(x)$$$ or $$$p_2(x)$$$)

================================================================================
* Markov chain

* Discrete-time based probability process

* Markov chain has markov characteristic

* $$$P(C_{t+1}|C_t,\cdots,C_1) = P(C_{t+1}|C_t)$$$

================================================================================
* Transition probatility: probability of A moving from i-state to j-state during time t

* $$$\gamma_{i\to j}(t) = P(C_{s+t}=j|C_{s}=i)$$$

================================================================================
* Transition probability matrix
* It displays all transition probatilities for all possible cases

* $$$\Gamma(t)= \{\gamma_{i\to j}(t)\}$$$
* $$$\Gamma=\Gamma(1)$$$

================================================================================
* Transition probatility matrix by using "Chapman-Kolmogorov equation"
* $$$\Gamma(t+u) = \Gamma(t) \times \Gamma(u)$$$

* $$$t+u$$$: summed time from t and u

================================================================================
* Hidden markov model

* Variant case from independent mixture model

* $$$C_t$$$ is markov chain and discrete probability process
$$$C_t$$$ selects one continuous probability distribution from independent mixture model

* Being selected continuous probability distributions $$$X_t$$$ are dependent 
on value of discrete probatility process $$$C_t$$$ at time $$$t$$$

* But you can't measure value of discrete probatility process $$$C_t$$$ at time $$$t$$$ 
You can only measure value of continuous probability distributions $$$X_t$$$

================================================================================
$$$P(C_t \mid |C_{t-1}, \cdots, C_1) = P(C_t \mid C_{t-1})$$$

$$$P(X_t \mid X_t, \cdots, X_1, C_t, \cdots, C_1) = P(X_t \mid C_t)$$$

================================================================================
* Decode

* You inference value of discrete random variable in observed hidden markov model
based on values of continuous random variable 

* Viterbi algorithm is most much used algorithm 
to inference value of discrete random variable in observed hidden markov model
