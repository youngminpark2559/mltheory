==================================================
Probabilistic sample(or random sample, sample): 
One realizable phenomenon from the probabilistic problem you want to solve 
Or one sampled case 

Sample space $$$\Omega$$$: 
Set which contains all possible samples 

Task of defining sample sapce:
Define which phenomenon is possible to occur
and which phenomenon is impossible to occur 

==================================================
Sample space when you toss the coin 
$$$\Omega =\{H,T\}$$$ 

==================================================
Some cases has set of entire real numbers as sample space 
$$$\Omega = \mathbf{R}$$$ 

==================================================
Possible events: possible sub sets of sample space $$$\Omega$$$ 

Sample space $$$\Omega=\{H,T\}$$$ 
Possible events: $$$\phi,\{H\},\{T\},\{H,T\}$$$

==================================================
Probability is function which takes all events
and which outputs number 

$$$P(A)=0.1$$$
P() is function P
A is event
0.1 is probability value

==================================================
Kolmogorov's axioms 

1. $$$P(\text{all\_events})\ge 0$$$ 
2. $$$P(\Omega)=1$$$ 
3. If $$$A\cap B=\phi$$$, then $$$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)$$$ 

==================================================
Interpretion about probability value: 
1. Frequentist 
2. Baysian 

==================================================
afafaf

Information of "event A has high probability value", 
"event B has medium probability value", 
"event C has low probability value", ... 
is called "probability distribution" 

==================================================
Elementary event (or atomic event): 
Elementary event has one number of sample 

$$$P({\text{Diamond}})=0.1$$$ 
$$$P({\text{Heart}})=0.2$$$ 
$$$P({\text{Spade}})=0.3$$$ 
$$$P({\text{Clover}})=0.4$$$ 

Then, you can calculate probability value of all kinds of events, 
which has 2 samples, 3 samples, etc 
according to 3rd rule of Kolmogorov's axiom 

$$$P({\text{Heart,Spade}})=0.2+0.3=0.5$$$ 

==================================================
Probability mass function: 
Probability mass function defines probability values
to each elementary event, 
when there are only finite number of events 

==================================================
$$$P(\{1\})=0.2$$$ 
$$$P()$$$ is probability function 
$$$\{1\}$$$ is event which has one sample 
$$$0.2$$$ is probability value for event $$$\{1\}$$$ 

$$$p(1)=0.2$$$ 
$$$p()$$$ is probability mass function 
$$$1$$$ is elementary event which has number 1 
$$$0.2$$$ is probability value for elementary event 1 

==================================================
$$$P(\{1,2\})=0.2$$$ 
$$$P()$$$ is probability function 
$$$\{1,2\}$$$ is event which has 2 samples 
$$$0.2$$$ is probability value for event $$$\{1,2\}$$$ 

$$$p(1,2)$$$ can be defined 

==================================================
Simple interval event A: $$$A=\{a\le x < b\}$$$ 

$$$A = \{ a \leq x < b \} \;\; \rightarrow \;\; P(A) = P(\{ a \leq x < b \}) = P(a, b)$$$ 

$$$P(B) = P(\{ -2 \leq x < 1\}) + P(\{2 \leq x < 3\}) = P(-2, 1) + P(2, 3)$$$ 

$$$P(B) = P(\{ -2 \leq x < 3 \}) - P(\{ 1 \leq x < 2\}) = P(-2, 3) - P(1, 2)$$$ 

==================================================
Cumulative distribution function: 
From above, you used 2 numbers to define "interval" or "simple interval event A" 

To use only one number, you can use negative infinity 

$$$
S_{-1} = \{ -\infty \leq X < -1 \}
S_{0} = \{ -\infty \leq X < 0 \}
S_{1} = \{ -\infty \leq X < 1 \}
S_{2} = \{ -\infty \leq X < 2 \}
\vdots
S_{x} = \{ -\infty \leq X < x \}$$$

==================================================
In interval $$$\{ a \leq x < b \}$$$ 
simple intervale probability $$$P(a, b) = P(-\infty, b) - P(-\infty, a)$$$

==================================================
Probability density function: 
derivative of Cumulative distribution function 

==================================================
Probability distribution function: 
Probability mass function 
Cumulative distribution function 
Probability density function
