This is note from the following video lecture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMAtFhamoRY

================================================================================
True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, False Negative

True, False: predicton of your model is correct or incorrect

Positive, Negative: 1 and 0 in classes

================================================================================
</xmp>
<table border="1"  cellpadding="5" text-align=center>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1000 pics in total</td>
<td>Model predicted it's non-tumor</td>
<td>Model predicted it's tumor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>On non-tumor pics</td>
<td>988 (True Negative)</td>
<td>2 (False Positive)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>On tumor pics</td>
<td>1 (False Negative)</td>
<td>9 (True Positive)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<xmp>

True Negative: The model correctly said 988 non-tumor images would be non-tumor images
False Positive: The model incorrectly said 2 non-tumor images would be tumor images
False Negative: The model incorrectly said 1 tumor image would be non-tumor image
True Positive: The model correctly said 9 tumor images would be tumor images

================================================================================
$$$\text{Accuracy}$$$
$$$=\frac{\text{TP}+\text{TN}}{\text{All cases}} $$$
$$$=\frac{9+988}{1000}$$$
$$$=0.99$$$

$$$\text{Precison}$$$
$$$=\frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP}+\text{FP}} $$$
$$$=\frac{9}{9+2}$$$
$$$=0.81$$$

$$$\text{Recall}$$$
$$$=\frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP}+\text{FN}} $$$
$$$=\frac{9}{9+1}$$$
$$$=0.9$$$

================================================================================
In addition to accuracy, precision, recall,
you will see ROC curve.

ROC curve is much used for binary classification and medical appications.

================================================================================
How can you interpret ROC curve?

Red curve line has better performance.

Area under curve line is called AUC (Area Under the Curve). 

================================================================================
Why do you need to use ROC curve?

Precision and recall are used to complement the weak point of accuracy.

ROC is also used to inspect analyzed result and dataset.

================================================================================

Probability distribution N means distribution of non-tumor images

Probability distribution P means distribution of tumor images

You can see clearly separated areas like far-left and far-right
but note that there are kind of unclear or overlapped areas around the center area.

Even if you have those unclear and overlapped areas,
you should have the best separating line like green vertical line

It means you can't avoid the errors in your separating line or in your decision.

================================================================================
</xmp><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mltheory/master/terry/YouTube/pics/2019_04_06_10:33:08.png' alt=''><xmp>

This graph is more easily separable.

Even if green vertical line moves in this graph,
you won't have many miss classifications because graph is already quite clear separable.
(decision boundary is less sensitive, you can more trust that you can separate N and P ,
you have good feature to separate N and P)

This situatino draws red-line-like graph in ROC curve.

================================================================================
If graph is not easily separable, almost-straight-diagonal-line is plotted on the ROC curve,
which is bad curve.

================================================================================
So, it means you can use ROC curve to select good features

================================================================================
For example, suppose you want to predict fast runners.

To train the mode, suppose you select "weight" and "height" as features.

But there are many vague cases where some tall people run fast, some tall people run slow,
some overweight people run fast, some lightweight people run fast, etc.

This situation draw distribution like 
</xmp><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mltheory/master/terry/YouTube/pics/2019_04_06_10:29:10.png' alt=''><xmp>
and draw almost-straight-diagonal-line on ROC curve

================================================================================
When you use good feature like record in previous test,
you can separate people into fast runner and slow runner

And that situation will draw following distribution and red-line-like good curve on ROC curve

================================================================================
True Positive rate (= Recall, sensitivity)

$$$\text{TPR=R}$$$
$$$=\frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP}+\text{FN}}$$$

================================================================================
True Negative rate (= Specificity)

$$$\text{TNR}$$$
$$$=\frac{\text{TN}}{\text{TN}+\text{FP}}$$$

================================================================================
Summary

1. Accuracy is not all
Especiialy, when class is inbalanced, you should see precision and recall
For example, first medical inspection should use recall cause it should detect every tumor patient.
Precision should be used for the case where your judgement shouldn't have mistake 
such as conviction.

2. Use ROC curve to confirm
that you're using good features, your decision is reliable and stable judgement
by checking your AUC has large area
