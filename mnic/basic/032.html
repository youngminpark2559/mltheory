032. Week 06. Training, Testing, Regularization - 01. Overfitting, Underfitting<br/><br/>
@<br/>
To understand training and testing, we need to understand bias and variance<br/>
<br/>
@<br/>
We need to understand relationship between bias and variance in terms of trade-off<br/>
<br/>
@<br/>
When we already have predicting model, how we to enhance performance of model<br/>
<br/>
@<br/>
What does it mean by better machine learning?<br/>
It can mean accurate prediction result<br/>
In classification, accurate dicision<br/>
In regression, accurate prediction value<br/>
<br/>
@<br/>
Suppose there is predicting model but always outputing "false"<br/>
And about data composed of 99 false and 1 true, predicting model can be said it can predict with 99\% accurately<br/>
<br/>
So, we need good evalution and validation methodology for predicting model, output result, and even data set, etc<br/>
<br/>
@<br/>
Training data is used to "parameter inference procedure"<br/>
We can also bring information from "prior knowledge" and "past experience"<br/>
<br/>
@<br/>
The weak point of machine learning is that machine learning predicting model is only effective only under assumption that distribution of given data is not changed<br/>
<br/>
If distribution of given data changed, we should make predicting model to learn newly<br/>
<br/>
@<br/>
The reasons or conditions machine learning can't be effective in industry can be following<br/>
When domain changes<br/>
When current domain doesn't show enough variance, we can't guarantee future effectiveness of predicting model<br/>
<br/>
@<br/>
Suppose this scenario<br/>
1. You are given N points to train predicting model with those N points data<br/>
1. You are going to train simple polynomial regression function Y=F(x)<br/>
1. Y=F(x) can be linear or unlinear according to its undetermine degree<br/>
<br/>
Now, consider following 3 F functions<br/>
Which one looks better?<br/>
<br/>
@<br/>
1st one is one degree linear funtion (underfitting)<br/>
I didn't train some pattern<br/>
There are more area to train<br/>
The train is insufficient<br/>
<br/>
2nd one is curved funtion (good one)<br/>
<br/>
3rd one is high dgree function to fit every data point (overfitting)<br/>
This one will make least error in respect to train data set<br/>
But this one can make higher error in respect to unknow data than simply curven function<br/>
<br/>
@<br/>
How to avoid "underfitting" and "overfitting" with some techniques?<br/>
<br/>
As degree of hypothesis function increases, predicting model(hypothesis fuction) becomes complex<br/>
But complex model with high degree doesn't mean better predicting model<br/>
<br/>
Then, question arises<br/>
Where should we stop increasing degree of hypothesis function?<br/>
<br/>
Is there measurement to calculate complexity and generality of hypothesis function?<br/>
<br/>
@<br/>
There is trade-off between complexity of model and generality of dataset<br/>
It means high generality of dataset brings low complexity of predicting model<br/>
It means low generality of dataset brings high complexity of predicting model<br/>
