Relationship between pattern of covariance and data's distribution

================================================================================
Since Gaussian probability distribution is very much used,
Gaussian probability distribution is also alternatively called normal distribution

================================================================================
The reason that Gaussian distribution is much used:

- When you use 1D feature vector like $$$x=[170,160,180]$$$ representing height values
only 2 parameters are enough to define normal distribution; mean $$$\mu$$$ and std $$$\sigma$$$

- Due to central limit theorem

- There are many cases where you need to use Gaussian distribution

================================================================================
Central limit theorem

- Suppose mean $$$\mu$$$, variance $$$\sigma^2$$$ of population.

- Since it's difficult to analyze entire population, you extract sample from population.

- As size of sample becomes bigger and bigger, 
that sample becomes data which has $$$\mu$$$ and $$$\frac{\sigma^2}{N}$$$
which represent statistical values of population

* Code
mean_of_pop=mean(population_data)
variance_of_pop=variance(population_data)

mean_of_sample=mean(large_sample_from_pop)
variance_of_sample=variance(large_sample_from_pop)

If n is enough big, 
mean_of_pop $$$\approx$$$ mean_of_sample
variance_of_pop $$$\approx$$$ variance_of_sample

================================================================================
* Example

* Suppose you want to predict average height of entire population.

* You would extract sample (people).

* Suppose you extract 1 person and you calculate average height of that person
Then, you will get this distribution

* Suppose you extract 4 people and you calculate average height of that people
Then, you will get this distribution
</xmp><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mltheory/master/jjpr/pic/2019_04_08_09:21:21.png' alt=''><xmp>

* Suppose you extract 7 people and you calculate average height of that people
Then, you will get this distribution

* Suppose you extract 10 people and you calculate average height of that people
Then, you will get this distribution

* As you increase size of sample, distribution becomes Gaussian distribution more and more.

================================================================================
* Multivariate Gaussian probability distribution function

$$$f_X(x)= \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}^{\frac{n}{2}} |\Sigma|^{\frac{1}{2}}} \exp \left[ -\frac{1}{2} (x-\mu)^T \Sigma^-1 (x-\mu) \right]$$$

* Shape of Gaussian probability distribution is determined 
by covariance $$$\Sigma$$$ between random variables
* $$$\mu$$$ only affects the peak, not for the shape.

================================================================================
* If covariance between random variables is shaped like following
$$$\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_1^2&&c_{12}\\c_{12}&&\sigma_2^2 \end{bmatrix}$$$

that data which is expressed via random variables has following distribution

================================================================================
* If covariance between random variables has following shape
$$$\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_1^2&&0\\0&&\sigma_2^2 \end{bmatrix}$$$
* $$$0$$$: correlation of data has none
* $$$\sigma_1^2 > \sigma_2^2$$$

data has following distribution
