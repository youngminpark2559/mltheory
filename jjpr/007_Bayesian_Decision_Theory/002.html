================================================================================
Since Gaussian probability distribution is very much used,
Gaussian probability distribution is also called Normal distribution

================================================================================
The reason that Gaussian distribution is much used:

- When you use 1D feature vector, 
it is enough to find normal distribution with 2 paramters; mean $$$\mu$$$ and std $$$\sigma$$$

- Due to central limit theorem, there are many cases where you need to use Gaussian distribution

================================================================================
central limit theorem

- Suppose mean $$$\mu$$$, variance $$$\sigma^2$$$ of population.

- Since it's difficult to analyze entire population,
you extract sample from population.

- As size of sample becomes bigger and bigger, 
that sample becomes data which has $$$\mu$$$ and $$$\frac{\sigma^2}{N}$$$

================================================================================
Example.

- Suppose you want to predict average height of entire population.

- You would extract sample.

- Suppose you extract 1 person and you calculate average height of that person
Then, you will get this distribution

- Suppose you extract 4 people and you calculate average height of that people
Then, you will get this distribution

- Suppose you extract 7 people and you calculate average height of that people
Then, you will get this distribution
</xmp><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mltheory/master/jjpr/pic/2019_04_08_09:21:42.png' alt=''><xmp>

- Suppose you extract 10 people and you calculate average height of that people
Then, you will get this distribution
</xmp><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mltheory/master/jjpr/pic/2019_04_08_09:22:00.png' alt=''><xmp>

- As you increase size of sample, distribution becomes Gaussian distribution more and more.

================================================================================
Multivariate Gaussian probability distribution function

$$$f_X(X)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}^{\frac{n}{2}} |\Sigma|^{\frac{1}{2}}} \exp \left[ -\frac{1}{2} (X-\mu)^T \Sigma^-1 (X-\mu) \right]$$$

Shape of Gaussian distribution is determined by $$$\Sigma$$$
$$$\mu$$$ only affects the peak, not for the shape.

================================================================================
If data has following distribution
</xmp><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mltheory/master/jjpr/pic/2019_04_08_09:30:44.png' alt=''><xmp>

that data has following covariance
$$$\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_1^2&&c_{12}\\c_{12}&&\sigma_2^2 \end{bmatrix}$$$

================================================================================
If data has following distribution
</xmp><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mltheory/master/jjpr/pic/2019_04_08_09:31:32.png' alt=''><xmp>

that data has following covariance
$$$\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_1^2&&0\\0&&\sigma_2^2 \end{bmatrix}$$$

$$$0$$$: correlation of data has none

$$$\sigma_1^2 > \sigma_2^2$$$

================================================================================
If data has following distribution
</xmp><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mltheory/master/jjpr/pic/2019_04_08_09:31:59.png' alt=''><xmp>

that data has following covariance
$$$\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^2&&0\\0&&\sigma^2 \end{bmatrix}$$$

$$$0$$$: correlation of data has none

$$$\sigma^2 = \sigma^2$$$

================================================================================
It also means that you can know the distribution of data by looking at the shape of covariance matrix
