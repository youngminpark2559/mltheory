This is note I wrote as I was take following lecture
http://www.kocw.net/home/search/kemView.do?kemId=1189957

================================================================================
* If you use decision function on Gaussian shape probability density function,
decision formular is expressed by 2-order of matrix wrt some variables

* That's why above method is called "2-order classifier"

================================================================================
* Various covariance matrix shape in Gaussian distribution makes various quadratic classifiers.

================================================================================
* Shape of Gaussian distribution function is defined 
by mean (location), std (width) when you deal with univariate random variable, 
covariance (shape of distribution) when you deal with multivariate random variable

================================================================================
* Case 1
$$$\Sigma_i=\sigma^2 I = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^2&&0&&0\\0&&\sigma^2&&0\\0&&0&&\sigma^2 \end{bmatrix}$$$

* (3,3) matrix: when you have 3 features (like height, weight, age), covariance matrix is (3,3)
* i: class like man and woman
* variances of classes are equal as follow
variance values are not dependent to class i
- $$$\sigma^2$$$: variance of feature 1
- $$$\sigma^2$$$: variance of feature 2
- $$$\sigma^2$$$: variance of feature 3
* Distribution of data: in 3D, perfect shape of sphere

* Distribution of data which has 2 classes
Size of variance and direction (or shape) are all same

================================================================================
* Case 2
$$$\Sigma_i= \Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_1^2&&0&&0\\0&&\sigma_2^2&&0\\0&&0&&\sigma_3^2 \end{bmatrix}$$$

* (3,3) matrix: when you have 3 features (like height, weight, age), 
covariance matrix is (3,3)
* i: class like man and woman
* size of variances of all classes are equal (how much of distribution spread is all same)
- $$$\sigma_1^2$$$: variance of feature 1
- $$$\sigma_2^2$$$: variance of feature 2
- $$$\sigma_3^2$$$: variance of feature 3
* $$$\sigma_1^2\ne \sigma_2^2 \ne \sigma_3^2$$$
- Size of variances of classes are equal but direction is different.
(long shape in y axis or long shape in x axis)

* Example in 2D
* There are 2 classes (like male and female)
* Each class has 2 features (like height and weight)

================================================================================
* Case 3

$$$\Sigma_i= \Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_1^2&&c_{12}&&c_{13}\\c_{12}&&\sigma_2^2&&c_{23}\\c_{13}&&c_{23}&&\sigma_3^2 \end{bmatrix}$$$

* (3,3) matrix: when you have 3 features (like height, weight, age), 
covariance matrix is (3,3)
* i: class like man and woman
* Size of variances of all classes are equal
- $$$\sigma_1^2$$$: variance of feature 1
- $$$\sigma_2^2$$$: variance of feature 2
- $$$\sigma_3^2$$$: variance of feature 3
* $$$\sigma_1^2\ne \sigma_2^2 \ne \sigma_3^2$$$
- Size of variances of classes are equal but direction is different.

* Example in 2D
* There are 2 classes (like male and female)
* Each class has 2 features (like height and weight)
* Note that direction of distributions how it's different from Case 2

================================================================================
* Case 4

$$$\Sigma_i= \sigma_i^2 I = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_i^2&&0&&0\\0&&\sigma_i^2&&0\\0&&0&&\sigma_i^2 \end{bmatrix}$$$

* Size of variances of all classes are different

* Distribution of data which has 3 classes (small, medium, large circles)
- Direction of spread is all same
- Size of variance is all different
</xmp><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mltheory/master/jjpr/pic/2019_04_17_11:07:18.png' alt=''><xmp>

Variance is different but shape (or direction) is same

================================================================================
* Case 5 (General case)

* $$$\Sigma_i \ne \Sigma_j$$$

* Size of variance of all classes are different.

* Direction of spead is all different

* Example of distributions of 3 classes
</xmp><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mltheory/master/jjpr/pic/2019_04_17_11:11:06.png' alt=''><xmp>

================================================================================
* Your goal is to find the optimal decision boundary
based on above distributions of classes

* Decision boundary is different per case

* Sometimes, it's linear line or curve line

* But all functions which represent that decision boundary are 2-order equation form
