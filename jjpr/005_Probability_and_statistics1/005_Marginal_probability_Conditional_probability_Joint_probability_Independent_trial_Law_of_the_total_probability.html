================================================================================
Marginal probability: probability value which is assinged into one event without conditions

================================================================================
Conditional probability
- Suppose there are 2 events A and B

- When probability value of event B occuring is known,
you can calculate probability of event A occuring in the situation of B occurred.

- $$$P[A|B]$$$

Under constraint of $$$P[B]>0$$$,
$$$P[A|B]=\dfrac{P[A\cup B]}{P[B]}$$$

- It's like a sample space becomes B

================================================================================
Joint probability
- You can get following equation from conditional probability.
$$$P[B]P[A|B]=P[A\cap B]$$$ or $$$P[A]P[B|A]=P[A\cap B]$$$

- Joint probability is the probability of both A and B occuring

- Independent trial: trial where each trial is independent to others like rolling a dice twice.
If A and B are independent events, $$$P[A|B]=P[A]$$$

- Therefore, you can write $$$P[A\cap B] = P[B] \times P[A]$$$

================================================================================
Law of the total probability

- Suppose sample space is composed of $$$B_1, B_2, \cdots, B_N$$$
</xmp><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mltheory/master/jjpr/pic/2019_04_07_16:38:09.png' alt=''><xmp>

- Suppose all Bs are not overlapped.

- Suppose event A is located like above.
Since A is entirely involved in S, A can be written as $$$a=A\cap S$$$

- You already supposed S is composed of $$$B_1 \cup B_2 \cup \cdots \cup B_N$$$
Therefore, you can write,
$$$A \cap (B_1 \cup B_2 \cup \cdots \cup B_N)$$$

- And you can write this,
$$$(A\cap B_1) \cap (A\cap B_2) \cup \cdots \cup (A\cap B_N)$$$

</xmp><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mltheory/master/jjpr/pic/2019_04_07_16:42:52.png' alt=''><xmp>

================================================================================
You can write above concept in terms of probability.

- $$$P[A]=P[A\cap B_1]+P[A\cap B_2]+\cdots+P[A\cap B_N]$$$

- You can use $$$P[A\cap B]=P[A|B]P[B]$$$ on above notation.
$$$P[A]=P[A\cap B_1]=P[A|B_1]P[B_1] + \cdots + P[A|B_N]P[B_N]$$$

- You can call above notation as the total probability of event A.
