12-02 Dimentionality reduction by PCA(principle component analysis)
<xmp>
=======================================================
feature extraction
=======================================================
N>M
N dimensional vector X
<linear feature extraction>
M dimensional vector Y

To perform linear feature extraction, you can multiply matrix by vector X, which is linear transformation method

$$$X = f(X) = Y = W^{M\times N}X$$$

$$$M*N \cdot N*1 \Rightarrow M*1$$$, where N>M

W can be very various
You want to find matrix W which keeps structure and information of vector X when finding Y, from very various W

=======================================================
according to selection of mapping function f
-> PCA, LDA
=======================================================

When you perform "feature extraction", selection of mapping function f will be determined by purpose of optimization

1. You sometimes perform "linear transformation" with purpose of "signal representation" 
Goal of extraction of feature :
In low dimension, precise express characteristics of original data 
Famous method for "linear transformation" with purpose of "signal representation" is PCA (principle component analysis) when finding matrix W

1. You sometimes perform "linear transformation" with purpose of "classification"
Goal of extraction of feature :
Better classification in low dimension
Famous method for "linear transformation" with purpose of "classification" is LDA (linear discriminant analysis) when finding matrix W

with purposes of "signal representation" and "classification"

1 : data which are involved in class 1
2 : data which are involved in class 2
Feature space : 2 dimensional plane
Number of feature : 2 (feature 1, feature 2)

Each individual data is 2 dimensional vector like data = $$$\begin{bmatrix} x_{1}^{(1} \\ x_{2}^{(3} \end{bmatrix}$$$

Since you have 2 dimensional vector (2 features), you want to reduce it to 1 dimensional vector

You can say data is projected based on -45 degree direction axis with purpose of signal representation, by using PCA 
You can say data is projected based on +45 degree direction axis with purpose of classification, by using LDA

One of important characteristic of data is distribution (variance)
You can see PCA keep variance of each data in 1 dimensional space

You can see LDA can help you when perform classify 2 data

METHODS to find direction of axis are PCA and LDA
