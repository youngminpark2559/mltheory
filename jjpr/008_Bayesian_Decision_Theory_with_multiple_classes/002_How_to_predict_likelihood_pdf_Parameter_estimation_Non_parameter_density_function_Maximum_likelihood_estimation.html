This is note I wrote as I was take following lecture

- How_to_predict_likelihood_pdf_Parameter_estimation_Non_parameter_density_function_Maximum_likelihood_estimation

================================================================================
So far, you've learned the way which classifies feature vector "when you know likelihood (as PDF)"

================================================================================
Then, how can you predict that likelihood PDF itself?

For example, you supposed you already know the distribution of heights of male and female.
But you actually don't know it. You should predict PDF from experiments and samples.

Techniques to predict likelihood PDF:
1. Parameter Estimation:
- You suppose the fact that PDF will have specific shape (Gaussian shape specifically)
Mean and variance are core elements which define Gaussian shape
- Parameter Estimation finds mean and variance of Gaussian distiribution by using Maximum Likelihood Estimation

2. Non-parametric Density Estimation
- You don't suppose the fact that PDF will not have specific shape
- Non-parametric Density Estimation just predicts likelihood PDF from data
- Kernel Density Esitimation, K Nearest Neighbor Estimation, etc

================================================================================
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

- It's the way which finds likelihood PDF by selecting best proper mean and variance

================================================================================

X: feature vector like heights

There should be population which generates feature vectors

What you want to do is to find the parameters which defines the shape of that population.

$$$\theta_1$$$: parameters which defines candidate population 1
$$$\theta_2$$$: parameters which defines candidate population 2

$$$P(X|\theta_1)$$$: probability of X occuring from population 1 which is defined by $$$\theta_1$$$
$$$P(X|\theta_2)$$$: probability of X occuring from population 2 which is defined by $$$\theta_2$$$

================================================================================
- Suppose there are other population and its corresponding $$$\theta$$$
/home/young/Pictures/2019_04_12_13:48:27.png

================================================================================
Then, you get this distribution

/home/young/Pictures/2019_04_12_13:49:54.png

$$$p(X|\theta)$$$: probability value of $$$X$$$ occuring from populations which are defined $$$\theta$$$

$$$\hat{\theta} = \arg_{\theta} \max[p(X|\theta)]$$$

$$$\hat{\theta}$$$: found $$$\theta$$$ which is best preper which defines best proper population
